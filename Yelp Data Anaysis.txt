Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table = 10000
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table =  10000
vii. hours table = 10000 
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562
iii. Category = 2643
iv. Attribute = 1115
v. Review = 10000
vi. Checkin = 493
vii. Photo = 10000
viii. Tip = 537
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: No
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
		select name, id, review_count from user
		order by review_count desc
		LIMIT 3;

| Yuri   | -8lbUNlXVSoXqaRRiHiSNg |         1339 |
+--------+------------------------+--------------+
		


8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
		No. If we select fans from user table, we can see Sara has more reviews, but has fewer fans than Yuri. The same can be said for Gerald too(we have to remove the limit) who has fewer fans than Herald (Review_count = 1153; Fans = 311).
	
+--------+------------------------+--------------+------+

| Yuri   | -8lbUNlXVSoXqaRRiHiSNg |         1339 |   76 |
+--------+------------------------+--------------+------+

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: There are more reviews with word "love" than with word "hate".

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

	Statement 1: 	select count (*) from review
					where text like '%love%';
					
				Count = 1780
				
	Statement 2:	select count (*) from review
					where text like '%hate%';
					
				Count = 232
				
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	Yes

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
    yes     
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
	The result thrown after the query is too little to infer anything from the location data. But from the available data, we can at least infer that businesses that operate for longer hours have better ratings.
	
SQL code used for analysis:

	select business.name, business.city, category.category, business.stars, 
	hours.hours, business.review_count, business.postal_code
	from (business inner join category on business.id = category.business_id) 
	inner join hours on hours.business_id = category.business_id
	where business.city = 'Charlotte'  group by business.stars;

		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         Average star_ratings of open businesses are higher than closed businesses.
			Open - 3.67900943396
			Closed - 3.52039473684 
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
         Average review_count of of open businesses are higher than closed businesses.
			Open - 31.7570754717 
			Closed - 23.1980263158 
		 In addition, there are more open businesses than closed businesses.
         
SQL code used for analysis:
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(id)), AVG(review_count), SUM(review_count),AVG(stars),is_open
	FROM business
	GROUP BY is_open

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         Finding the correlation between the reviews texts with review star ratings. 
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

         We'd need two data sources. First, we'd use join and then sort them to see what kind of reviews the customers wrote and correlate them with ratings. This, when looked deeply, would help in determining pros and cons in detail and would help buinsesses in making better decisions.
         
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
